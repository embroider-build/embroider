  body: |
    Automated and continuously updated PR for adding changeset entries for merged PRs.

    TODO
    - [ ] Determine patch/minor/major impact for each package for each changeset
    - [ ] if applicable, mark/remove certain changes as omitted from the changelog
    - [ ] if applicable, bundle changes together in to a single "change set"

    Remember
    - This PR is updated on every merge to `main`
    - This PR is force-pushed, so changes should happen on a separate branch
