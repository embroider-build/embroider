# Analyzing Bundles

Now that the default implementation of Embroider uses Vite you should follow the [official Vite documentation for performance](https://vite.dev/guide/performance). Embroider no longer needs to provide Ember-specific tooling around this sort of analysis.

You might also want to look into [vite-bundle-visualiser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-bundle-visualizer) if you are upgrading from `webpack-bundle-analyzer`
