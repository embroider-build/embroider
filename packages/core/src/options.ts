  // Every file within your application's `app` directory is categorized as a

  // This option lets you decide which "other" files should be loaded
  // statically. By default, all "other" files will be included in the build and
  // registered with Ember's runtime loader, because we can't know if somebody
  // is going to try to access them dynamically via Ember's resolver or AMD
  // runtime `require`.
  //
  // If you know that your files are only ever imported, you can list them here
  // and then they will only be included exactly where they're needed.
  //
  // Provide a list of directories or files relative to `/app`. For example
  //
  //     staticAppPaths: ['lib']
  //
  // means that everything under your-project/app/lib will be loaded statically.
  //
  // This option has no effect on components (which are governed by

  // route-specific files (routes, route templates, and controllers which are
  // governed by splitAtRoutes).

  // optimization if you've manually verified that a particular package doesn't
  // need transpilation to be safe in your target browsers.

  // As of ember-source 3.27 Ember.js is optionally consumable as real
  // JavaScript modules. This makes Ember.js's module graph visible to the
  // optimizing compiler, enabling tree-shaking and other optimizations of
  // ember itself.
  //
  // Unfortunately due to backwards compatibility constraints consuming
  // ember-source this way wont be the default until ember-source@4.0.0.

  // is slower because some babel plugins are non-serializable" penalty. If you
  // provide the locations of known non-serializable objects, we can discover
  // them and make them serializable.
  //
  // resolve is a list of paths to resolve, in a chain. This lets you resolve
  // your dependencies' dependencies, like: resolve: ['your-dependency',
  // 'inner-dependency/lib/transform']

  // useMethod optionally lets you pick which property within the module to use.
  // If not provided, we use the module.exports itself.

  // Our addons' implicit-modules and implicit-test-modules are not necessarily
  // resolvable directly from the app, but the meaning of those
  // backward-compatibility features is "the app should import this module". So
  // we need some strategy for making them importable by the app. We can either
  // turn those imports into complete relative paths, or leave them as package
  // names:
  //
  // relativePaths:
  //
  //   import('./node_modules/intermediate/node_modules/some-addon/thing.js')
  //
  // packageNames:
  //
  //   import('some-addon/thing.js')
  //
  // When building under a tool like webpack, the relativePaths are safe and
  // always work, although they can be uglier to look at when debugging in
  // development.
  //
  // When building under a tool like snowpack, the package names can be easier
  // to work with because you already have web-bundles per package, and can't
  // necessarily address arbitrary places on the filesystem.
  //
  // Defaults to "relativePaths".
