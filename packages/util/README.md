# @embroider/util

## ðŸš¨ Deprecation notice ðŸš¨

This package is deprecated. It provided the `ensureSafeComponent` utility function and the `ensure-safe-component` template helper. Both of these do nothing at runtime on Ember versions >= 3.25.

Any code that's using `@embroider/util` should switch to directly using Template Tag (also known as "Template Imports"). Template Tag works in all Ember versions all the way back to 3.27.o

## Intro

Utilities to help apps and addons with Embroider support.

## Compatibility

- Ember.js v3.13 or above
- Ember CLI v2.13 or above
- Node.js v10 or above

## Installation

```
ember install @embroider/util
```

## The Utilities

### `ensureSafeComponent`

**This function is intended to help addon authors who still need to support Ember < 3.25**. In all other cases, instead of using this you should directly pass components around as values (not as strings) and invoke them directly with angle brackets (not the `{{component}}` helper).

For the full explanation of why and how you would use this, see [the Addon Author Guide](https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/blob/main/docs/replacing-component-helper.md).

Example usage in Javascript:

```js
import { ensureSafeComponent } from '@embroider/util';
import Component from '@glimmer/component';
import DefaultTitleComponent from './default-title';

export default class extends Component {
  get title() {
    return ensureSafeComponent(this.args.title || DefaultTitleComponent, this);
  }
}
```

```hbs
<this.title />
```

Example usage in a template:

```hbs
{{#let
  (ensure-safe-component (or @title (component 'default-title')))
  as |Title|
}}
  <Title />
{{/let}}
```

The first argument is allowed to be:

- a string. If we see a string, we will emit a deprecation warning because passing components-as-strings doesn't work safely under Embroider with `staticComponents` enabled. We will return a value that is safe to invoke (via angle brackets) on your current Ember version.
- a curried component definition (which is the kind of value you receive when someone does `<YourComponent @customThing={{component "fancy"}}/>`). These are returned unchanged, because they're always safe to invoke.
- a component class, in which case if your ember version does not yet support directly invoking component classes, we will convert it to a curried component definition for you.

In the Javascript version, you must pass a second argument that is any object with an owner (a `Component` instance works great).

## Glint usage
If you are using [Glint](https://typed-ember.gitbook.io/glint/) and `environment-ember-loose`, you can add all the macros to your app at once by adding

```ts
import type { EmbroiderUtilRegistry } from "@embroider/util";
```
to your app's e.g. `types/glint.d.ts` file, and making sure your registry extends from EmbroiderMacrosRegistry:

```ts
declare module '@glint/environment-ember-loose/registry' {
  export default interface Registry
    extends EmbroiderUtilRegistry, /* other registries here */ {
      // ...
    }
}
```
